            <h1>About the Project</h1>
            <p><em>This is a website designed to raise awareness about carbon emissions on a global scale. Contained on the 
                data page is the websiteâ€™s main feature, a tool to visualize real time point source carbon emissions per 
                country aggregated by sector. The website interacts with the CarbonMapper API, fetching its data on point 
                source carbon emissions collected by satellites and allowing for it to be displayed by country in an easy 
                to read manner. On the Take Action page is a number of ways individuals can impactfully contribute to the 
                important fight against climate change and reducing carbon emissions. This website was built for my final 
                project of the ANTH481 class at the University of Maryland, College Park. </em>
