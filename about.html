            <h1>About the Project</h1>
            <p><em>This is a website designed to raise awareness about carbon emissions on a global scale. Contained on the 
                data page is the websiteâ€™s main feature, a tool to visualize real time point source carbon emissions per 
                country aggregated by sector. The website interacts with the CarbonMapper API, fetching its data on point 
                source carbon emissions collected by satellites and allowing for it to be displayed by country in an easy 
                to read manner. On the Take Action page is a number of ways individuals can impactfully contribute to the 
                important fight against climate change and reducing carbon emissions. This website was built for my final 
                project of the ANTH481 class at the University of Maryland, College Park. </em>

            <h1>
                Motivations
            </h1>
            <p><em>The issue of climate change is the biggest that the world faces today, as there are serious negative 
                impacts on the world that will take place in the relatively near future if nothing is done about the issue.
                 Fighting climate change is difficult because of its global scale, long-term nature, interconnected 
                 challenges, and its requirement for large scale behavioral change. We are commonly told to reduce our carbon
                  footprint by being less wasteful on a day to day basis, but in reality, unless you are a billionaire this 
                  type of advice barely puts a dent in the colossal amount of carbon emissions that are released everyday. 
                  This website provides information on how individuals can actually contribute meaningfully to the fight 
                  against climate change, starting with raising awareness about carbon emissions and then guiding individuals 
                  to take action in the right ways.
            </em>

                Future Plans
            </h1>
            <p><em>
                I plan to implement greater functionality to this website in the future, bringing together more insightful 
                statistics on carbon emissions and climate change to further raise awareness on the issue. I also plan to 
                compile more information on ways that individuals can contribute to the fight against climate change. </em>
